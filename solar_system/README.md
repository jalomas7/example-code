# solar_system
This is an openGL application which renders a basic model of an unary solar system.
The code in skeleton was written by myself, with the exception of a few naming 
conventions in jmesh.h and part of the glut initialization section of solar_system.c.  

The aforementioned parts were created by Dr. Jian Huang at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

The .off files in off/ are examples for use by solar_system, and were given by Dr. Huang and myself.
