This java program takes an NxN matrix from the command line and prints the minimum number of changes needed to make the matrix
"Skew Symetric" (MT = -M). 

Takes N command line arguments, each command line argument should be a string of N space-separated integers between [-99:99] inclusive.


Example Usage: 'java SkewSymetric "5 5 5" "-5 3 2" "-5 -2 0"' will output:
   5   5   5
  -5   3   2
  -5  -2   0
minimum changes needed = 2
